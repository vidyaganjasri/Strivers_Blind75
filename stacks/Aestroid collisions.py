'''Problem: Asteroid Collision
Youâ€™re given a list of integers representing asteroids moving along a line.
Positive values â†’ asteroids moving right
Negative values â†’ asteroids moving left
Asteroids move at the same speed.

When two asteroids moving in opposite directions meet:
The smaller one explodes
If they are equal, both explode
If they move in the same direction, nothing happens
Your goal: Return the state of the asteroids after all collisions.

âœ… Key Rule:
Only a left-moving asteroid (-ve) that comes after a right-moving asteroid (+ve) can cause a collision.

ğŸ’¡ Idea: Use a Stack
We use a stack to keep track of asteroids:
Push all positive asteroids (they're moving right)
When a negative asteroid appears:
Keep checking the top of the stack
While there's a smaller positive asteroid on top â†’ pop it (it explodes)
If both are equal â†’ pop the top and don't push the negative (both explode)
If the negative is smaller â†’ it explodes (do nothing)
If there's no positive asteroid to fight â†’ just push the negative one

stk = []
for ast in asteroids:
    if ast > 0:
        # Asteroid moving right â€” just push to stack
        stk.append(ast)
    else:
        # Asteroid moving left â€” possible collision
        while stk and stk[-1] > 0 and stk[-1] < abs(ast):
            # Stack top is smaller positive â†’ it explodes
            stk.pop()
        if stk and stk[-1] == abs(ast):
            # Both are equal â†’ both explode
            stk.pop()
        elif not stk or stk[-1] < 0:
            # No collision â†’ push the negative asteroid
            stk.append(ast)
return stk
