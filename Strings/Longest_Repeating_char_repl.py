'''
Time Complexity: O(N^2 * 26) (for each substring, finding max frequency among 26 letters).
Logic:
Outer loop picks the start index i of the substring.
For each start index, we initialize a hashmap (or array of size 26) to count frequencies.
Inner loop extends the substring from i to j.
Update the character count.
Calculate conversions = (j - i + 1) - max_freq_in_window.
If conversions <= k, update max_len.
Return the maximum length.

Time Complexity: O(N) â€” each character is processed at most twice.
Logic:
Initialize:
left = 0, right = 0, max_len = 0, max_freq = 0
Hashmap/array to keep frequency count.
Expand window with right++:
Update character count and max_freq.
Calculate window_len = right - left + 1
If window_len - max_freq > k, too many conversions:
Shrink window from the left: left++, and update character count.
Keep updating max_len = max(max_len, right - left + 1)
Return max_len.
